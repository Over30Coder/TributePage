        <p>Marcus Bontempelli is widely considered the greatest Bulldogs player of all time.</p>
        <p>Drafted as a bolter in 2013, he quickly stamped his authority on the game in his first year as a professional AFL footballer, kicking one of the best goals of the season.</p>
        <p>Since then, he has developed into one of the most complete players in the AFL, helping the Western Bulldogs win the premiership in 2016 (their first in 62 years) before leading them to another grand final in 2021 where they were defeated by Melbourne.</p>
